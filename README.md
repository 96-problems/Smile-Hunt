# Smile-Hunt
Donate through Amazon Smile everytime you purchase a book through Product Hunt.

This #1DayHack was inspired by a tweet convo w/ [@AndrewDixonSo](http://twitter.com/AndrewDixonSo)
thanks to his conscientious use of an Amazon Smile Link when he hunted Insanely Simple.

Using smile.amazon.com 0.5% of your purchase goes to charity. Learn about it in their video:

It's easy to forget to smile, especially when rushing to be first to hunt a book.

With Smile Hunt a "â€¦With a ðŸ˜„" button is added that will redirect you to the smile version of the book.
